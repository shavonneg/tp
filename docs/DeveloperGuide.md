--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API
** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is invoked to execute a command, it delegates the command to an `BookKeeperParser` object. This object
   then
   creates a parser corresponding to the command type (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and utilizes it to interpret the
   command.
2. This process generates a `Command` object (to be more specific, an instance of one of its subclasses, e.g.,
   DeleteCommand) which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. During execution, the command can interact with the `Model` (e.g., to delete a `Client` or manage `Order`
   details).<br>
   While this interaction is depicted as a singular step in the above diagram for the sake of simplicity, the actual
   implementation may involve multiple interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to accomplish the
   intended task.
4. The outcome of the command's execution is encapsulated within a `CommandResult` object, which is then returned from
   `Logic`. Additional classes in `Logic` (not shown in the class diagram above) that are utilized for parsing a user
   command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

### Model component

**API
** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="682" />


The `Model` component,

* stores bookkeeper data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Order` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Order>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `BookKeeper`, which `Client` references. This allows `BookKeeper` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API
** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

Below is an updated UML class diagram illustrating the relationships and interactions among the various storage-related
classes:

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component of our application is responsible for handling the reading and writing of data to and from
external storage sources.
This includes functionalities such as saving and retrieving bookkeeper data and user preferences.
In this section, we will delve into the recent enhancements made to the `Storage` component, focusing on the
implementation of storing clients and order details.

In this enhancement, the `Storage` component has been extended to support the storage and retrieval of both client and
order details.
Previously, the `Storage` component was primarily designed to handle bookkeeper data and user preferences. However,
with the growing requirements of our application, it becomes necessary to accommodate the storage of clients and orders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Order class

![BetterOrderClassDiagram.png](images%2FBetterOrderClassDiagram.png)

Order is a new class added to encapsulate the logic of an Order. It has a composition relationship with the `Client`
class, and contains the following attributes:

1. OrderDate
2. Deadline
3. Price
4. Description
5. Status

The OrderDate is the time in which the order is created.  
The Deadline is the time in which the order is due, which is specificed by the user.  
The Price is a Double type where it represents the price for the order, and follows a numerical format of 2 decimal
places.  
The Description a String type which holds the description of the Order.
The Status is an enum String value consisting of either `pending`, `completed`, `canceled`.

### Storing an Order

To implement this feature, several modifications were made across different classes within the `Storage` package. The
key changes include:

1. New Classes: The introduction of `JsonAdaptedClient` and `JsonAdaptedOrder` classes to facilitate the conversion
   between JSON format and the corresponding model objects (`Client` and `Order`).

2. Updated Interfaces: The `BookKeeperStorage` interface was extended to included methods for reading and writing
   orders. Similarly, the `Storage` interface, which serves as an umbrella for all storage-related functionalities,
   was update to incorporate these changes.

3. Storage Manager: The `StorageManager` class, which orchestrates the storage operations, was modified to delegate the
   handling of client and order data to the appropriate storage classes.

4. Unit Tests: Unit tests were added or updated to ensure the correctness and robustness of the new functionalities.

#### Why it is implemented this way:

With the implementation of storing clients and orders details, the `Storage` component of our application has been
enhanced to better meet the evolving needs of our users. These changes not only improve the functionality of our
application but also lay the groundwork for future enhancements and features.

Future plans may involve further optimizing the storage mechanisms, exploring alternative storage formats, or
integrating additional data validation checks to ensure data integrity. Overall, the recent enhancements to
the `Storage` component
mark a significant step forward in enhancing the robustness and flexibility of our application.

### Adding an Order Feature

This feature allows users to add orders to our application for viewing and storage.

The sequence diagram below showcases the interactions within the application
![AddOrderSequenceDiagram.png](images%2FAddOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

An `ObservableList` has been added to the `ModelManager` for the sole purpose of displaying our `Order` objects.
Additionally, the following classes and methods have been added to support the implementation of this feature:

1. `AddOrderCommand`  
   Created a `AddOrderCommand` class to cater to order creation inputs by the user. This will get the
   referenced `Client` by their index in the `ObservableList` and check if the `Client` index is valid.
   Afterwards, it will override the `#execute` method & append the `Order` object into the `Client` object's respective
   orders list via the model interface.
   Upon execution of this command, it will return the `CommandResult` on for the output box to indicate if it was a
   successful command or not.
2. `AddOrderCommandParser`  
   Creating a `AddOrderCommandParser` class to create the respective `Command` object by parsing the user input. This
   flow is as intended, and will allow us to get index of the `Client` object in the `ObservableList` and get the
   required parameters typed by the user by parsing it with the `Prefix` objects in `CliSyntax` class.
   For this command, the prefixes used would be `d/` for description, `c/` for price and `by/` for the deadline.
   The respective `AddOrderCommand` will then be created to be executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Why it is implemented this way

1. Separation of Concerns:   
   By delegating specific responsibilities to specialized classes (like `BookKeeperParser`,
   `AddOrderCommandParser`, etc.), the design adheres to the principle of separation of concerns. This means each part
   of
   the system has a clear responsibility, reducing complexity and making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

### Deleting an Order Feature

This feature allows users to delete Orders from our application permanently.

The sequence diagram below showcases the interactions within the application:
![DeleteOrderSequenceDiagram.png](images%2FDeleteOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

This will delete both the `Order` in the `ObservableList` for orders and from the `Client` object as well.

The following classes and methods have been added to support the implementation of this feature:

1. `DeleteOrderCommand`  
   Created a `DeleteOrderCommand` class to cater to delete orders by their index in their `ObservableList` class.
   This will allow the users to delete by index instead of the UUID. The `DeleteOrderCommand` first checks
   the `ObservableList` by index to determine if the `Order` index is valid, then checks which `Client` the `Order`
   object belongs to. This allows the modification of both `Client`s and `Order`s at the same time.
   Upon execution of this command, it will return the `CommandResult` on for the output box to indicate if it was a
   successful command or not.
2. `DeleteOrderCommandParser`  
   Creating a `DeleteOrderCommandParser` class to create the respective `Command` object by parsing the user input.
   This flow is as intended, and will allow us to get index of the Order object in the `ObservableList`.
   This will create the respective `DeleteOrderCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.

#### Why it is implemented this way

1. Separation of Concerns:   
   Again, by simply delegating specific responsibilities to specialized classes (like `DeleteOrderCommandParser` and
   `DeleteOrderCommand`), the design adheres to the principle of separation of concerns. This means each part
   of the system has a clear responsibility, reducing complexity and making the codebase easier to understand and
   maintain.

### Editing an Order Feature

This feature allows users to edit Orders objects in our application.

The following sequence diagram describes the flow:

The following classes and methods have been added to support the implementation of this feature:

1. `EditOrderCommand`  
   Created a `EditOrderCommand` class to cater to allow editing Orders by the user. It will first search the `Order`
   objects in the `ObservableList` to ensure that the index is valid, before finding the `Client` object that
   the `Order` object belongs to.
   Afterwards, the `Order` object is edited, and will be replaced in the `Client` object's orders list to update the
   details. This will be encapsulated and returned in a `Command` object that will be executed in the main logic.
2. `EditOrderCommandParser`  
   Creating a `EditOrderCommandParser` class to create the respective `Command` object by parsing the user input.
   This flow is as intended, and will allow us to get index of the Order object in the `ObservableList` and get the
   required parameters typed by the user by parsing it with
   the `Prefix` objects in `CliSyntax` class. For this command, the prefixes used would be `d/` for description, `c/`
   for price and `by/` for the deadline.
   These prefixes are optional, and not including them will use the current `Order` object details.
3. `EditOrderCommandParser#EditOrderDescriptor`  
   This is a nested static class within the `EditOrderCommand` class that manages the `Order` information.
   It's role is to temporarily hold the values of `Order` information that may or may not be updated. It acts as a data
   transfer object that contains the details to be edited by the user.
   Additionally, it helps to validate the fields to ensure that there are only valid values will be accepted, and to
   parse and apply the edits.

#### Why is it implemented this way:

It was done in this manner to adhere to the following design principles:

- Provide Extensibility: With a modular structure, adding new functionality (like future order implementations)
  involves creating new classes and modifying existing ones minimally. This approach makes the system more extensible,
  as seen with the introduction of new parser and command classes for handling orders.
- Enhances Frontend Integration:  By redefining how the `ObservableList` is managed within the `ModelManager` for
  Orders, we enhance our capability to directly manipulate the `OrderList` view in JavaFX. This adjustment in the
  ModelManager class creates a seamless and responsive interaction between the backend data structures and the frontend
  user interface.

### View Orders feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed View Orders mechanism is facilitated by `ViewOrdersCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the
displaying of all orders that belong to a client.

These operations are exposed in the `BookKeeperParser` class as `BookKeeperParser#parseCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view orders mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookKeeper` will be initialized with the
initial bookkeeper state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bookkeeper state.

Step 2. The user executes `viewOrders` command to view all the orders that they have in BookKeeper. The `viewOrders`
command calls `Model#updateFilteredOrderList()`, causing bookkeeper to show the list of orders
that are tracked in the storage of the application. The `viewOrders` command then returns a new `CommandResult`, which
displays the `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` message, which is "Here are all your orders: ".

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How view command executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Retrieves and displays all client orders from the filtered order list.
    * Pros: Simple and straightforward implementation.
    * Cons: May result in a slower performance and higher memory usage if the filtered order list is large.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement system for displaying orders and only load a subset of orders at a time.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. can use cache mechanisms to store recently accessed orders in memory).
    * Cons: More complex implementation of storage and memory access.

**Why is it implemented that way**

* This approach is chosen for its simplicity. By utilising the filtered order list maintained by the model, the
  `viewOrders` command provides a straightforward way to display all orders to the user. It also makes it easier to
  maintain.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Klara is a florist and owner of Royal Bloom, a thriving floral shop in Singapore.
As her business grows, managing the increasing volume of orders and client information becomes more complex and
time-consuming.

Recently, the demand for personalised and expedited flower arrangements has risen, leading to challenges in keeping up
with client requests and order specifics. This has resulted in Klara needing a more efficient way to manage her shop’s
operations to maintain customer satisfaction and business growth. In response, Klara's florist mentor, Jenna, suggests
implementing a more convenient system to streamline these processes.

Therefore, Jenna has recommended BookKeeper, a desktop application designed to assist florists like Klara. BookKeeper
will help Klara manage her growing list of clients and orders.

Klara is tech-savvy and prefers tools that enhance productivity while streamlining her workflow. She values
desktop applications for their reliability and performance and is accustomed to managing digital tools that save time
and reduce manual efforts.

Klara is a small business owner of a florist shop, specifically a freelance hobbyist in the floral industry. She has
the requirements of:

* Prefers efficient ways to manage their clients and their information.
* Prefers an efficient way to keep track of client's orders.
* Values productivity and time-saving solutions.

(Note: Klara and Jenna are fictional characters, created based on research of the needs of real florist business owners)

**Value proposition**:

* Manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

* Note: The details of the deleted order in the command output box will correspond to the details of the order deleted
  at the index.

### Editing an order

Pre-requisite:

* There must at least be one client and one order in the application.
* You must know the index of the order you want to edit.

Command: `editOrder INDEX [by/DEADLINE] [c/PRICE] [d/DESCRIPTION] [s/STATUS]`

* Examples:

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Enhanced Error Messaging
    * Implementing more specific error messages for the "edit" and "editOrder" functions to provide clearer guidance
      to users encountering issues.
2. Enhanced Error Messaging for Wrong Indices with Missing Fields
    * For the `edit` command, if the user fills in 0 fills but an invalid index, the error message is "At least one
      field to edit must be provided."
    * This will be changed to note the invalid index in the future.
3. Extended Tag Length and Error Refinement
    * Increase the maximum length of tags supported within the system, enabling users to provide more descriptive labels
      and organize content effectively.
4. Resolution Support
    * Expand resolution support to include additional screen resolutions such as 1280x720, catering to a broader range
      of devices and user preferences.
5. Allow filtering of orders based on displayed customers.
    * Allow users to filter orders based on the displayed customers, providing a more streamlined and efficient
      experience for users managing multiple clients.
6. Allow adding of multiple users with the same name.
    * Allow users to add multiple clients with the same name, enabling users to manage multiple clients with similar
      names more effectively.
7. Relax constraints on field data types
    * There are constraints on length of values that may prevent overly long fields from being displayed correctly.
        * E.g. do not input a name that is too long, as it may not be displayed correctly.
    * There a constraints on size of values due to the innate storage system. Numbers cannot be too large.
        * E.g. do not input an Order Price that is unrealistically large for flower orders e.g. 9 billion (
          9,000,000,000).

## **Appendix: Effort**

Our project aimed to develop a comprehensive solution tailored for florist to manage both client information and order
delivery tracking seamlessly. Unlike AB3. which focuses only on the client entity, our project extended its scope to
include orders, thus introducing complexity in managing bidirectional navigation and ensuring seamless integration
between client and order functionalities.

### Challenges Faced

1. *Bidirectional Navigation* - Implementing bidirectional navigation between orders and clients posed a significant
   challenge. Ensuring that
   modifications to one entity reflected accurately in the other required meticulous attention to detail.
2. *Linking Orders to Clients* - Establishing a robust linkage between orders and clients presented difficulties,
   especially during operations
   like delete or edit. Coordinating changes on both client and order sides to maintain data correctness demanded
   careful
   planning and execution.
3. *Collaborative Development* - Each team member had to work on features and functions independently, necessitating
   close
   collaboration to ensure seamless integration. Communication was important to minimize merging conflicts and ensure
   that
   individual components linked are successfully done.

### Effort Required

The project demanded a considerable effort due to its expanded scope and the complexities associated with managing
multiple entity types. Coordinating development efforts, addressing integration challenges, and ensuring feature
completeness required dedicated time and resources.

### Achievements:

Despite the challenges, we successfully delivered a robust product that allow florists to manage client information
seamlessly while effectively tracking order deliveries.

Key achievements include:

* Implementing bidirectional navigation between client and order entities.
* Establishing robust linkages between orders and clients, ensuring data consistency throughout.
* Facilitating collaborative development and integration efforts to deliver a cohesive solution.
