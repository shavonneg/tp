## 1. Purpose of User Guide (UG)

BookKeeper is a desktop app designed for florists, in particular to manage their clients and orders when selling
flower bouquets.

Our User Guide (UG) provides florists with a comprehensive resource to understand and use BookKeeper effectively.
Inside, we have outlined clear instructions, explanations, and best practices in order to aid florists in navigating
BookKeeper’s features seamlessly. This UG is crucial to help florists comprehend the application’s functionalities,
optimise their workflows, and maximise productivity with ease.

BookKeeper is also optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (
CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BookKeeper can get your
client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

in managing client relationships and orders. Our target audience includes small florist shops, independent floral
designers, and boutique flower businesses.

### 3.2. Assumptions

1. Our application is made with the assumption that users are members of the florist industry and will understand the
   needs as well as the terminology used by florists. They can either be business owners, managers, or employees and
   are looking for a tailored solution to streamline their operations.
2. Users are presumed to have a basic understanding of computer operations and software usage. This can help them to
   navigate easily through the application and follow the instructions to download and use BookKeeper,
   as provided in this guide.
3. While prior experience with customer relationship management (CRM) systems and command line interfaces (CLIs) can
   help users to familiarise themselves with BookKeeper fast, BookKeeper is also entry-level-friendly so that we can
   accommodate users of all levels of technical expertise.

### Saving the data

BookKeeper data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to
save manually.

### Editing the data file

BookKeeper data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/bookkeeper.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, BookKeeper will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the BookKeeper to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## 7. Information about how to use the guide

What do the colours mean?

BookKeeper mainly uses four colours: beige, muted green, creamy yellow, and warm brown.

We hoped to achieve a cohesive colour scheme that not only shows visual hierarchy, but provides florists with a sense
of familiarity by choosing colours that are reminiscent of nature. The neutral colour palette caters to a the wide
diversity of florists, be it with respect to age group or gender, while also ensuring that the app remains timeless
and appealing.

This combination of colours not only enhances the aesthetics of BookKeeper, but also promises a user experience that
is consistently positive and engaging.

## 8. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
